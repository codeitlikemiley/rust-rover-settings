# Rust Rover Settings For MACOS (Only)

Since Rust Rover is free until Sept 2024, why not used it?

All I can say is that the keybinding is shitty as hell,

I wanted to be using CMD + [1-9] on mac like on vscode to tab my ways

Also I want to make the configuration as close as my [nvim](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/nvim) , so i can switch back and forth without any issue...
